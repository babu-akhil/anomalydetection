# Unsupervised video anomaly detection

Exploring unsupervised and semi supervised methods in video anomaly detection.
Currently working on UCSD-Ped 1 Dataset.


Training the model:

Edit train.py and put your dataset path name instead of the default one.
Dataset should be in this format:
Parent folder /
--> subfolder 1
  ---> im001
  ---> im002
         .
         .
         .
  ---> im00n
--> subfolder 2
        .
        .
        .
---> subfolder n

Then run train.py
